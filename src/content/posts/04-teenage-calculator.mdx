This is still a work in progress. The aesthetic is inspired by the [Teenage 
Engineering K.O. II Sampler](https://teenage.engineering/store/ep-133/). 

I spent way too long messing with the glare
using a CSS `clip-path` which is probably not the best tool for the job -- but
at least I understand clip-path now ðŸ˜¤

You can play with the slider below!


<Calculator />

My next step is adding some global control for the drop shadow direction and depth
for each element.
